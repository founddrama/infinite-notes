================================

To play along, you'll need:

* a copy of *Infinite Jest*;
* [nanoc](https://nanoc.ws/); and
* [kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/)


What's this all about?
----------------------

It's about *Infinite Jest* by David Foster Wallace. We love this book. And/but/so: we are (re-) reading it. These are our notes. Feel free to fork, patch, contribute, and/or what have you.

How do I... play?
-----------------

Make notes. Write essays. Connect the dots. Go nuts. It's free-form.
