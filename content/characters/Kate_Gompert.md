Kate Gompert
------------

When we meet Kate (in the narrative) she is on the 5th floor of the psych. ward
following her 4th suicide attempt.

> Classic unipolars were usually tormented by the conviction that no one else
> could hear or understand them when they tried to communicate.

(pp. 75)

Kate has got (what sounds like) basically the same problem as [Erdedy](/characters/Erdedy).

Ultimate fate: kidnapped by Marathe et al. and convinced to watch [The Entertainment](/misc/The_Entertainment)
