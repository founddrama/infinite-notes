Orin Incandenza
---------------

> "morning is the soul's night"

The oldest Incandenza boy.

Punter for the AZ Cardinals, #71.

Gave up tennis at approx. 17, when Hal was 9, and Mario was 11.

(There is a whole big long discourse on O. leaving tennis, and going to B.U.
presumably to play tennis, and but then to play football, and [CT](/characters/CT)
taking over the H.M. duties at [ETA](/places/ETA), and all the tension that was
bound up in all of *that*.)

**Whereupon** Orin meets [PGOAT](/characters/Joelle) at BU during like week 3 of
class (approximately) and is instantly smitten and "defects" from tennis to
college football.

**Whereupon** Orin has a meteoric rise in success at college ball, as a punter;
and but so then it gets ruined through a rather ravishing injury.

Orin is obsessed with bedding young mothers. (pp. 245)

<h3>Orin and [The Entertainment](/misc/The_Entertainment)</h3>

The A.F.R. believe... (pp. 723)

* that Orin has (or has knowledge of) a master copy of *Infinite Jest*
  * *i.e.*, [The Entertainment](/misc/The_Entertainment)
* that M. DuPlessis had received *his* copy of The Enterainment from Orin
  * (any other text to support this?)
* which begs the question: how did Orin get involved w/ M. DuPlessis?
  * and what was his motivation for leaking it to him?
* and which also suggests: that M. DuPlessis' copy of the The Entertainment
  leaked to "outside" during [Gately's](/characters/Don_Gately) botched robbery
