Orin Incandenza
---------------

> "morning is the soul's night"

The oldest Incandenza boy.

Punter for the AZ Cardinals, #71.

Gave up tennis at approx. 17, when Hal was 9, and Mario was 11.

(There is a whole big long discourse on O. leaving tennis, and going to B.U.
presumably to play tennis, and but then to play football, and [CT](/characters/CT)
taking over the H.M. duties at [ETA](/places/ETA), and all the tension that was
bound up in all of *that*.)

**Whereupon** Orin meets [PGOAT](/characters/Joelle) at BU during like week 3 of
class (approximately) and is instantly smitten and "defects" from tennis to
college football.

**Whereupon** Orin has a meteoric rise in success at college ball, as a punter;
and but so then it gets ruined through a rather ravishing injury.
