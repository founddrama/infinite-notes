James O. Incandenza (Himself; the Mad/Sad Stork)
-----------------------------

The patriarch of the Incandenza family.

* persistent hallucination that [Hal](/characters/Hal) does not speak
* pp. 31 - implication that he has "an entertainment cartridge" implanted in his skull
  * Hal + John N.R. Wayne + Gately dig up his head? for that? (what is it?)
* indicated that he did some important work toward "cold annular fusion"
  * not explicit BUT : easy to interpret from those part of the narrative that
    Himself would have patents -- and thus: that explains why the family is so
    well-off

<h3>on Himself's Father</h3>

* a (failed) actor
  * and on that note: *anti*-method acting; very anti-Brando
* an (arguably) failed tennis pro
* planned to "build a tennis pro" out of young James

<h3>on Himself's Death</h3>

* in the Year of the Trial Size Dove Bar
  * at age 54
* buried at Qu√©bec's L'Islet County
