James O. Incandenza (Himself; the Mad/Sad Stork)
-----------------------------

The patriarch of the Incandenza family.

* communication problems of all kinds, apparently
  * persistent hallucination that [Hal](/characters/Hal) does not speak
    * Himself's ghost admits to [Gately](/characters/Don_Gately) that Hal was
      most like him (Himself) and had become fearful that Hal was becoming a
      figurant
  * tells [Joelle](/characters/Joelle) that he cannot speak to his "undamaged"
    sons w/o the presence and mediation of [Avril](/characters/Avril)
* pp. 31 - implication that he has "an entertainment cartridge" implanted in his skull
  * Hal + John ('N.R.'') Wayne + [Gately](/characters/Don_Gately) dig up his
    head? for that? (what is it?)
* indicated that he did some important work toward ["cold annular fusion"](/misc/annular_fusion)
  * not explicit BUT : easy to interpret from those part of the narrative that
    Himself would have patents -- and thus: that explains why the family is so
    well-off
* often rendered impotent with this obsessive idea that the world had a finite
  number of erections (i.e., only so many boners for the whole world) and he did
  not want any wasted on himself

<h3>on Himself's Father</h3>

* a (failed) actor
  * and on that note: *anti*-method acting; very anti-Brando
* an (arguably) failed tennis pro
* planned to "build a tennis pro" out of young James

<h3>on Himself's Death</h3>

* in the Year of the Trial Size Dove Bar
  * at age 54
* buried at Qu√©bec's L'Islet County
* [Clipperton](/characters/Clipperton) suicide footage (allegedly) buried with him
  * see pp. 408, fn. 160

<h3>Filmography</h3>

See fn. 24: pp. 985-993

"Poor Yorick Entertainment"

> "conceptually unfilmable"

* *The Man Who Began to Suspect He Was Made of Glass*
  * IIRC: important to theme
* *Pre-Nuptial Agreement Between Heaven and Hell*
  * IIRC: mentioned many times
* *The ONANtiad*
  * significant to [ETA](/places/ETA) somehow
* *Wave Bye-Bye to the Bureaucrat*
* *Infinite Jest* (V)
  * "completion of (IV)"
  * (prev. version(s) unfilmable?)
  * (possibly version IV?)
  * **motivation:** to coax Hal into *feeling* and *conversing*, to create
    something that was *more* than something that Hal could 'simply master and
    move on'
