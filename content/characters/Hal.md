Harold James (Hal) Incandenza
-----------------------

Our nominal narrator and (anti?) hero. Aged 17 during much of "the action" of
the story, the events during YDAU. Left-handed.

<h3><em>I cannot make myself understood.</em></h3>

Novel opens with Hal's first-person narration. November in the Year of Glad,
down at the University of Arizona; his smile is more of a grimace, his words are
incomprehensible.

> "I ate this."

RE: mold (Weston, MA) -- as a child

> "I am not what you see and hear."

[C.T.](/characters/CT) on Hal:

> "He's fine when he's by himself."

(Hal as introvert? introducing a theme there?)

<h3>Year of the Tucks Medicated Pad</h3>

* Himself is still alive
  * and has this persistent hallucination that Hal does not speak

> That's *Webster's Seventh*. That's not the *O.E.D.*

* Hal found [Himself's](/characters/Himself) body
  * found Himself with his head in the microwave

> something smells delicious

**Hal's Grief Therapy**

* re: consumed by trying to "pass" grief therapy (like it's a test)
* not actually processing the grief itself
  * (does he even need to? (see also: "Hal as HAL 9000"?))

<h3>Year of the Perdue Wonderchicken</h3>

> ...case-study in the eschatology of emotional appeals.

(pp. 414)

<h3>Year of the Depends Adult Undergarment</h3>

* pp. 49 - 1st appearance of the one-hitter
* [Avril](/characters/Avril) never leaves the grounds

<hr />

Textually: passages / sections that are "first person Hal" (w/r/t/ POV) are
sections where Hal "cannot make [himself] understood"; example:

* the opening passage in AZ
* when Ortho thinks he's crying
* when Kenkle and Brandt think he's laughing

<hr />

THEORY: Hal as HAL
------------------
* Hal : HAL 9000 :: Himself : Stanley Kubrick
* Hal as a machine, so programmed, that comes undone
