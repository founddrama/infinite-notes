Harold (Hal) Incandenza
=======================

Our nominal narrator and (anti?) hero.

*I cannot make myself understood.*
----------------------------------

Novel opens with Hal's first-person narration. November in the Year of Glad, down at the University of Arizona; his smile is more of a grimace, his words are incomprehensible.
