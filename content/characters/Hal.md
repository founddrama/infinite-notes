Harold (Hal) Incandenza
=======================

Our nominal narrator and (anti?) hero.

*I cannot make myself understood.*
----------------------------------

Novel opens with Hal's first-person narration. November in the Year of Glad, down at the University of Arizona; his smile is more of a grimace, his words are incomprehensible.

> "I ate this."

RE: mold (Weston, MA) -- as a child

> "I am not what you see and hear."

[C.T.](/characters/CT) on Hal:

> "He's fine when he's by himself."

(Hal as introvert? introducing a theme there?)
