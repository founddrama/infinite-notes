(pp. 541) First rats; then cats; also dogs.

1st active de-mapping of a cat is United Nations Day (24 Oct.); he strikes it
(while it's inside the SteelSak) against a no-parking sign, after it scratched
his wrist. (pp. 544)

pp. 538 - description of Lenz's way of dealing with settling into sobriety;
*i.e.*, by killing small animals during his walks home from AA/NA meetings (more
on this in the "[Bruce Green](/characters/Bruce_Green)" entry)

> Lenz has such a panoply of strange compulsive habits that a request for
> SteelSaks barely raises a brow on anybody.

(pp. 542)

Lenz is using cocaine while at Ennet House ("two or three, maybe half a dozen
times tops, secretly", pp. 543)

Lenz kills animals by:

* stomping them (rats)
* suffocating them in Glad SteelSak garbage bags (cats)
* striking them while they're inside the SteelSak (cats)
* tuna fish, poisoned with Raid (cats)
* dousing with kerosene and setting on fire (cats)
* left-over Gately meatload, poisoned with Raid (dogs)
* slitting their throars with his X444 Browning knife (dogs)

Lenz visualizes (but does not commit) the murder of a homeless man.

Ultimate fate: kidnapped by Marathe et al. and convinced to watch [The Entertainment](/misc/The_Entertainment)
