RE: Gately's climax -- is he beaten by FLQ? (see fn. 47)

Gately routinely drives Pat Montesian's priceless black 1964 Ford Aventura,
despite not really having a license...

> ...for Gately the vehicle's so terrifically tight and sleek it's like being
> strapped into a missle and launched at the site of a domestic errand.

(pp. 461)

<h3>(Boston) AA</h3>

Some lengthy discussion (couched in/around Gately's own experience of same) of:

* AA
* Boston AA
* [Ennet House](/places/Ennet_House) and AA
* Gately and AA
* and c.

(pp. 443)

Gately's main addiction is actually with oral narcotics (and Demerol in
particular), but decides to go the AA route instead of NA. (*Ed. note:* go back
and find the citation for this that contains the reason why.)

<h3>Pre-Ennet House</h3>

* a girlfriend: Pamela Hoffman-Jeep (pp. 465)
  * (same Pamela as Lenz's tattoo???)

<h3>Childhood and Family</h3>

* for a while he and his mother lived in a beach house, but they were only able
  to afford the rent because it had a huge gaping hole in the roof that the
  owner had simply covered with plastic (pp. 800)
* nicknamed "Bim" or "Bimmy"
  * his mother called him that
    * because she heard the neighborhood kids calling him that
  * he didn't have the heart to tell her
    * it stood for **Big Indestructible Moron** (pp. 448)
* "Sir Osis of Thuliver" (pp. 449)
* First gets high (smokes a 'desBois') at age 9 (pp. 903)
  * and then (incidentally) watches footage of the Rodney King beatings

<h3>Hospitalized at St. Elizabeth's</h3>

*unsure of the day when he regains consciousness...*

* briefly shares a room with Otis P. Lord
* [Ewell](/characters/Tiny_Ewell) visits him and confides
* Pat M. visits him, assures him that everything will be OK, that they at Ennet
  House take care of their own (implying that she is running interference for
  him w/r/t/ the Finest etc.)
* [Calvin Thrust](/characters/Calvin_Thrust) comes and gives him an update
  * this update includes everything that happens *after* Gately got shot and
    lost consciousness -- so we (as readers) do get that part of the story, but
    we get it as told by Thrust
* and there's Gately, shot and toxemic and refusing pain medication, absolutely
  miserable and all he can think about (while Thrust is talking) is: 
  *Who is cooking the dinner at the house?*
* [Geoffrey Day](/characters/Geoffrey_Day) visits Gately and confides
* Gately is visited by [Himself's](/characters/Himself) <del>ghost</del>
  *wraith* (pp. 829)
  * **figurants** (pp. 835)
* Gately dreams a dream-like and embellished (and but highly personal) version
  of [<em>Infinite Jest</em>](/misc/The_Entertainment)
* Gately dreams/hallucinates a visit from Ferocious Francis that gets
  interrupted by a Pakistani MD that keeps describing Gately's pain, and how the
  pain is going to get worse, and then keeps offering him (Gately) various
  powerful narcotics for the pain
* McDade and Diehl visit, but aren't there to confide, and brought a 'promoted'
  Get Well Soon card (unsigned)
