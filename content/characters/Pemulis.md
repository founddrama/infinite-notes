Michael Pemulis

> Sure I'm Paranoid. **BUT AM I PARANOID ENOUGH?***

Close friend to [Hal](/characters/Hal), native of Allston, MA. At [ETA](/places/ETA)
on the optics scholarship; *not* much of a tennis player (when compared to his
rather elite peers).

Greatest fear: explusion from ETA.

Hates ETA psychologist [Dolores Rusk](/characters/Dolores_Rusk). The origin of his hate is quite hazy; he always
enumerates various obvious reasons to Hal.
