DMZ

*a.k.a.*, Madame Psychosis

> ...like LSD that has *itself* dropped LSD...

*Ed. note:* DMZ is a fictional hallucinogen

**Ultimate fate of the DMZ in the story?** Not explicit? Believed: Hal obtains
it (somehow) from Pemulis, takes it, and it causes a psychic meltdown of some
form or another (hence the business with everyone misinterpretting his facial
expressions and tone of voice).
