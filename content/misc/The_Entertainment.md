The Entertainment
-----------------

An unfilmable (???) film, created by [Himself](/characters/Himself). Said to be
*so* entertaining that anyone who watches it will not be able to break away.

<h3>April 1, Year of the Depends Adult Undergarment</h3>
* the medical attach√© receives The Entertainment
  * it arrives in a plain padded mailer
  * it bears a smiley face and envelope reads "HAPPY ANNIVERSARY!"
  * return address points to Phoenix, AZ
  * the cartridge is otherwise unmarked

<h3>What's it about?</h3>
* Marathe and Steeply discuss theories about it. (pp. 490-491)
  * mostly around it being ultimately entertaining
  * (and then there's Marathe's political screed about passivity)
* Molly Notkin's description which (presumably) comes from
  [Joelle](/characters/Joelle) (pp. 788)
  * that it otherwise sounds like a self-important (boring) art film with a
    technical trick that only an optics genius could love
  * that it involves Joelle (naked and but veiled or otherwise facially
    distorted) talking (literally) *down* to the camera (again: fitted with some
    kind of crazy special lens) and going into some monologue about how death is
    always a woman, and how that woman is always your mother in your next life
  * titled either *Infinite Jest (V)* or *...(VI)*
